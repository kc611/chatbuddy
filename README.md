# Chatbuddy ( A Django Chat APP )

This is a chat application built with help of with Django Channels. It also features a user login/registration system using the inbuilt django user model.

  Please note this is a demo project of the concepts used in building a chat app. It is simply not production ready. For example, when the backend receives a message, it'll broadcast to everyone in the room including the sender. This means when you demo the sender role, be aware you'll see every outbound message duplicated. The project is setup for deployment however work is being done to get this up and running.
 
 ##### PS: A responsive frontend is under development backend is completed.
